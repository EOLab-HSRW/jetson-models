</p>

This repository provides a Python-based models manager designed for running AI inference models on a Jetson device. It leverages NVIDIA's Jetson Inference Library to manage the models. The manager also sets up a WebSocket server, enabling remote clients to control different models and send images for real-time inference.

The primary goal of this manager is to allow users to interact with various AI models in real time using Snap!, a block-based programming language. It supports launching, retraining, and using specific inference models, making it easy to demonstrate how AI detection models work and learn.
